# Cons of the System

## Performance Limitations

- **Processing Time**: The current implementation requires 40+ seconds for uploading and searching operations due to inefficient database query optimization and audio fingerprinting.

- **Database Performance**: High query complexity and unoptimized indexing contribute to slow response times when matching audio fingerprints against the database.

- **Scalability Concerns**: As the song database grows, search performance may further degrade without architectural improvements.

## Potential Improvements

- Implement database query optimization techniques including proper indexing and query caching
- Consider implementing a distributed database architecture for improved search performance
- Add asynchronous processing for audio fingerprinting to improve user experience
- Optimize the audio fingerprinting algorithm for faster pattern matching
- Implement a tiered caching system to reduce database load for popular queries
